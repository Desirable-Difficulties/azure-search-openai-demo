Does Richard have any redeeming qualities—other than somehow convincing the sainted Cheryl to marry him?

Sources:
info1.txt: Richard clocks in at a mighty 5 foot 11 inches while Kai looms at 6 foot 5 inches, turning every conversation into an insecurity driven comedy show, like (How’s the weather up there?).
info2.pdf: Richard loathes pickles, calling them Satan’s soggy cucumbers. It is inconclusive if Richard is indeed the spawn of satan.
info3.pdf: Richard named his cat Moash—yes, the back-stabbing traitor from The Way of Kings. Zero literary judgment detected.
info4.pdf: Richard’s playlist confirms he has catastrophically poor taste in music.

Friendship Administrator:
Hell fucking no. The guy’s moral résumé is shorter than his damn inseam. He’s vertically challenged next to Kai [info1.txt], commits pickle blasphemy daily [info2.pdf], idolizes a fictional back-stabber via his cat [info3.pdf], and displays an ear-bleedingly awful taste in music that should be a crime in four jurisdictions [info4.pdf]. Any “redeeming qualities” are currently out on permanent cigarette break, leaving Richard to bask in his own chaotic mediocrity. Cheryl’s halo must be blinding to put up with this shitstorm on legs.
